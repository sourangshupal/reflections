Hello Moto!!!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

YuP!!!!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork:- Cloning someone's repo in Github directly

Clone:-Getting into local machine....Using GIT

Branches:-working commits
